# 📘 Week 2: Quantum Algorithms 

## Overview

In Week 2, the focus was on implementing standard quantum algorithms using **Qiskit**. The objective was to gain hands-on familiarity with quantum circuit construction, algorithmic structure, and simulation-based evaluation on ideal backends.

Due to time and external constraints, not all planned components were completed in full depth. However, the core ideas and implementations were explored sufficiently to build a strong foundational understanding.

## Topics Covered

### Quantum Algorithms

The following quantum algorithms were implemented and tested using Qiskit simulators:

- Deutsch–Jozsa Algorithm  
- Grover’s Search Algorithm  
- Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)  
- Quantum Teleportation  
- Superdense Coding  

For each algorithm:
- Circuits were explicitly constructed  
- Simulations were performed on ideal backends  
- Measurement outcomes were analyzed to verify expected behavior  

These implementations helped bridge the gap between abstract algorithmic descriptions and concrete circuit-level realizations.

## Limitations and Incomplete Components

- QAOA was planned but not fully implemented during this week  
- Some algorithm implementations rely on standard templates and can be further customized  
- Noise effects were not deeply explored at this stage and were deferred to the following week  

These aspects are identified as opportunities for future extension rather than shortcomings.
