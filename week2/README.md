Week 2: Quantum Algorithms and Variational Methods
Overview

In Week 2, the focus was on implementing standard quantum algorithms and exploring variational quantum algorithms using Qiskit. The objective was to gain hands-on familiarity with quantum circuit construction, algorithmic structure, and simulation-based evaluation on ideal backends.

Due to time and external constraints, not all planned components were completed in full depth. However, the core ideas and implementations were explored sufficiently to build a strong foundational understanding.

Topics Covered
1. Quantum Algorithms

The following quantum algorithms were implemented and tested using Qiskit simulators:

Deutsch–Jozsa Algorithm

Grover’s Search Algorithm

Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)

Quantum Teleportation

Superdense Coding

For each algorithm:

Circuits were explicitly constructed

Simulations were performed on ideal backends

Measurement outcomes were analyzed to verify expected behavior

These implementations helped bridge the gap between abstract algorithmic descriptions and concrete circuit-level realizations.

2. Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)

An introductory implementation of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) was carried out, including:

Construction of a parameterized ansatz

Evaluation of expectation values

Use of classical optimizers

Execution on ideal simulators

This exercise provided insight into:

the hybrid quantum–classical workflow

parameter optimization strategies

sensitivity of VQE to ansatz choice and circuit depth

Limitations and Incomplete Components

QAOA was planned but not fully implemented during this week

Some algorithm implementations rely on standard templates and can be further customized

Noise effects were not deeply explored at this stage and were deferred to the following week

These aspects are identified as opportunities for future extension rather than shortcomings.
