# qiskit-learning
Learning portfolio covering Qiskit basics, noise modeling, and Trotterized Ising dynamics.
# Qiskit Learning Portfolio

This repository contains a set of Jupyter notebooks developed as part of a
self-directed study of quantum computing using Qiskit.

## Contents

### 1. Qiskit Basics
- Quantum circuits and registers
- Common single- and multi-qubit gates
- Circuit visualization
- Measurement and transpilation basics

### 2. Noise Modeling
- Introduction to quantum noise
- Depolarizing and thermal relaxation noise
- Noisy vs ideal simulation using Qiskit Aer
- Effect of noise on simple quantum states

### 3. Ising Model Simulation
- 1D transverse-field Ising model
- Lie-Trotter decomposition
- Second-order Suzuki-Trotter decomposition
- Time evolution of observables

> Note: The Ising model notebook is based on IBM Quantum learning material and
is used here for educational purposes.

## Tools Used
- Qiskit
- Qiskit Aer
- NumPy, SciPy
- Matplotlib

## Background
This work was completed during a winter break to build practical skills in
quantum computing and prepare for a research project in quantum technologies.
